#~~~~~~~~~ Functions -----

# writing a function
## function syntax:
## AwesomeFunctionName <- function(argument1, argument2,â€¦){
##                                                         do stuff here
##                                                        }
## The last thing that appears in the 'do stuff here' section is the function's 
## "return value"

# YOUR TURN: write a function that takes input "nrep", replicates '(mean(rnorm(100)))'
# nrep times, and draws a histogram of the results

replicate(1000,mean(rnorm(100)))

histnorm100 <- function(nrep){
  hist(replicate(nrep,mean(rnorm(100))))
}

histnorm100(1000)
histnorm100(7)
histnorm100(10)

# YOUR TURN: modify your function
## to draw a histogram of nrep mean(rnorm(n)), where n is another input

histnorm <- function(nrep, n){
  hist(replicate(nrep, mean(rnorm(n))))
}

histnorm(10,5)
histnorm(100,5)
histnorm(1000,5)
histnorm(10000,5)

#~~~~~~~~~ Simulating no effect and check alpha -----

# YOUR TURN: draw from the same normal distribution twice 
## and see if the sample differ from each other
## will they differ significantly in 5% of the nrep?
### Figure out how to do a t.test in R  
### Generate two vectors of 10 values drawn from N(0,1) and compare them with a t test  
### Figure out how to extract the p-value from that object (HINT use `str` or `names`)
### Write a function simT that generates two vectors of n random normals, 
# compare them with a t test and return the p-value  
### Repeat with nrep = 20 and draw a histogram for n = 10
### Repeat with nrep = 100 and draw a histogram for n = 10    

?t.test

x1 <- rnorm(10, 0, 1)
x2 <- rnorm(10, 0, 1)

t.test(x1,x2)

str(t.test(x1,x2))
names(t.test(x1,x2))

t.test(x1,x2)$p.value

simT <- function(n){
  y1 <- rnorm(n)
  y2 <- rnorm(n)
  t.test(y1,y2)$p.value
}


simT(1000)
simT(10)


#~~~~~~~~~ Simulating an effect and check power -----

# we can calculate the power of a t.test for a given sample size using:
power.t.test(n = NULL, delta = 0.5, sd = 1, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8)
# the required sample size is 64 per group.

# YOUR TURN: Use your simulation skills to work out the power of a t-test for a given sample size through simulation.
## Write a function which:
### 1. Draws from two random normal distributions with different means and a given sample size
### 2. Compares the means with a t.test and extracts the p.value
## Then, use that function to replicate the function 1000 times using the parameters used in the power calculation.
## Calculate the proportion of p-values that are <0.05

simT2 <- function(n, m1, m2){
  z1 <- rnorm(n, m1)
  z2 <- rnorm(n, m2)
  t.test(z1,z2)$p.value
}

simT2(100, 25, 60)

setseed(2004)

p <- replicate(1000, simT2(64, 0, 0.5))

par(mfrow = c(1,1))
hist(p, breaks = 21, col = c('red',rep('grey',20)), 
     main = "nrep = 1000, n = 64, delta = 0.5", xlab = 'pvalue')

prop.table(table(p < 0.05))


#~~~~~~~~~ Simulating for a preregistration  -----

# YOUR TURN: 
## Try to make a dataset that looks like this, using the 
## functions `data.frame()`, `sample()`, and `rnorm()`    

# smoking_status lung_cancer sex      age
# 1            Yes          No   M 12.67918
# 2            Yes         Yes   F 23.71397
# 3             No          No   M 28.87786
# 4            Yes          No   F 28.99327
# 5            Yes         Yes   F 30.41415
# 6             No          No   M 44.60615

setseed(12345)

N <- 10
yn <- c("Yes","No")

df <- data.frame(
  smoking_status = sample(yn, N, replace = T),
  lung_cancer = sample(yn, N, replace = T),
  sex = sample(c("M","F"),N, replace = T),
  age = rnorm(N, 30, 10))



# YOUR TURN:
## Run a logistic regression on the data with lung cancer as the outcome and
## adjusting for the other variables. 
## You could try something like:
## glm(lung_cancer ~ smoking_status, sex, age, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = df)
## Why doesn't it work? Try to trouble shoot and get the code to work!

## HINT: are the variables the correct data type?
## HINT: once the model works, use summary() to look at the results

df[1:3] <- lapply(df[1:3], as.factor)

m1 <- glm(
  lung_cancer ~ smoking_status + age + sex, 
  family = binomial(link = logit),
  data = df)

summary(m1)
